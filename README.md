# Intrusion_Detection_System
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a type of security system that monitors network traffic and alerts system administrators or security personnel when it detects suspicious or unauthorized activity. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source library of computer vision algorithms and tools that can be used for image processing, object detection, and tracking.

Video surveillance: OpenCV can be used for video analysis to detect intrusions in physical spaces, such as unauthorized access to a restricted area or suspicious behavior in a public space.
